What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n","\n","Answer 1:\n","\n","The five key concepts of OOP are:\n","\n","1.Encapsulation: This concept involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. Encapsulation helps to protect the internal state of an object from unintended interference and misuse by restricting access to some of the object's components. It is achieved through access modifiers like private, protected, and public.\n","\n","2.Abstraction: Abstraction refers to the principle of hiding the complex implementation details of a system and exposing only the essential features. By focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it, abstraction allows programmers to work with objects at a higher level, making it easier to manage complexity and interact with the system.\n","\n","3.Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class. This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. The existing class is called the parent or base class, while the new class is referred to as the child or derived class.\n","\n","4.Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single function or method to operate in different ways depending on the object that invokes it. This can be achieved through method overriding (where a child class provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class) and method overloading (where multiple methods have the same name but different parameters).\n","\n","5.Composition: Composition involves creating complex types by combining objects of other types. Instead of inheriting from a base class, a class can contain objects of other classes to achieve functionality. This \"has-a\" relationship allows for greater flexibility and modular design, as changes to the composed classes can be made independently without affecting the entire system."],"metadata":{"id":"BbYGJRJCaHHD"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#2.

How does Python implement method overloading?

In those languages, you can define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within the same class. Python, however, uses a different approach.\n","#In Python, method overloading is achieved through default arguments, variable-length arguments, or by manually handling different types of inputs within a single method.
